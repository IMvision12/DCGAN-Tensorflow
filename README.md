# DCGAN-Tensorflow
A Tensorflow implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks in Tensorflow proposed in the paper [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). The main contribution comes from the tricks which stablize the training of Generative Adversarial Networks.
